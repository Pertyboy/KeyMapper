### Credits

Many thanks to...

 - @[dslul](https://github.com/dslul) for their [OpenBoard](https://github.com/dslul/openboard) fork of the AOSP keyboard! This made adding a GUI keyboard for Key Mapper _much_ easier. ðŸŽ‰
 - @[salomonbrys] for his [Kotson] library so I can easily use Gson in Kotlin.
 - Hannes Dorfmann (@[sockeqwe]) for his [AdapterDelegates] library. You can read his [article] demonstrating why delegation is better than inheritance.
 - The [Material Design Icons] community for various icons that are not provided by Google.
 - Daniel Cachapa (@cachapa) for this [ExpandableLayout](https://github.com/cachapa/ExpandableLayout) library.
 - Heinrich Reimer (@[heinrichreimer]) for his [Material Intro](https://github.com/heinrichreimer/material-intro) library.
 - [App Mockup] for their screenshot utility.
 - Airbnb for their [Epoxy](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy) RecyclerView. They made having multiple itemview types and dragging and dropping super easy!
 - @[Jake Wharton](https://github.com/JakeWharton) for his [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) logging library.
 - @[noties](https://github.com/noties) for his [Markwon](https://github.com/noties/Markwon) Markdown View library.
