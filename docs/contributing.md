## Consistency Standards

### Writing

It is important to use consistent language within the app's code and documentation. Make sure that your submissions comply with these standards. If you have noticed inconsistencies you can alert the developer with [an issue](https://github.com/sds100/KeyMapper/issues/new) or in [the Discord](http://keymapper.club). These standards don't need to be followed in places other than the documentation and source code. Follow this Material Design [guide](https://material.io/design/communication/writing.html).

#### Case

No title case unless it is the title of a webpage, section heading. No title case in the string resources in the source code at all.

Here are words and phrases that have been spelt inconsistently by the developer and everyone should follow these guidelines.
