## Consistency Standards

### Language

It is important to use consistent language within the app's code and documentation. Make sure that your submissions comply with these standards. If you have noticed inconsistencies you can alert the developer with [an issue](https://github.com/sds100/KeyMapper/issues/new) or in [the Discord](http://keymapper.club). These standards don't need to be followed in places other than the documentation and source code.

Here are words and phrases that can be spelt or capitalised in multiple ways.

| Terminology           | Correct üòç                                                    | Incorrect üëø                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| The app's name. | **Key Mapper**<br />Use **Keyboard/Button Mapper** when advertising the app as this is how it appears in the app stores. You can use "Key Mapper" in the rest of the advert since this is much shorter. | key mapper, keymapper              |
| A key map       | **key map**. In variable and class names it should be keymap, fooKeymap instead of fooKeyMap. The class KeyMap is an exception. | keymap, Key Map. key-map. Key-Map. |
| A trigger       | **trigger**                                                  | Trigger                            |
| An action       | **action**                                                   | Action                             |
| A constraint    | **constraint**                                               | Constraint                         |
