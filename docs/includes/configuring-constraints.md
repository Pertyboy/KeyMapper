You can add special constraints to your gestures maps in order to customise when they are allowed to run.

To add a constraint fron the 'Constraints and more' or 'Options' tab, tap 'Add constraint'.

You can view the list of constraints to choose from [here](../user-guide/constraints.md).

If you have more than two constraints you can choose between an 'AND' and 'OR' mode. For 'AND' mode all the constraints need to be satisfied and for 'OR' mode at least one needs to be.
