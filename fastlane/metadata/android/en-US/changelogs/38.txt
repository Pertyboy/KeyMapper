Added

- Support for Android 11.
- Backup/Restore keymaps.
- Option for keycode actions to simulate holding the key down.
- Button to show system packages as well in the app list.
- Action to create Key Event with optional modifiers.
- Action to select word at cursor.
- Action to toggle the screen on and off.
- Action to tap a coordinate on the screen. The user and the app can NOT touch the screen at the same time. This is a
limitation in Android.
- Action to double press recents to go to last app.
- Dismiss button to the notification that pauses/resumes keymaps. It will be shown again when the app is opened.
- Show a warning dialog when leaving the screen to configure a keymap without saving.
- Keymaps can have multiple of the same action. There is now a slider in the action options called "Action Count".
- Can detect the headset button when the screen is off.
- Prompt the user to reboot their device if they fail to record a trigger 2 times in a row.
- Show a toast after using the Screenshot (ROOT) action.
- Consuming the key event is optional for each key.

Changed
- Don't hide the Repeat option if there is no trigger.

Fixes
- Caps Lock key still caps lock when remapped.
- When making a parallel trigger, the keys don't all have the same click type.
- Dragging trigger keys by the remove button would cause a crash
- stop recording if the user leaves the Trigger fragment
- The Menu (ROOT) action was slow
- show a toast if there is an IOException when detecting buttons when the screen is off.
- Remapping modifier keys to modifier keys doesn't work as expected.
- the Screenshot (ROOT) action didn't create the Pictures and Screenshots directories. Therefore, it didn't save the screenshot.
- Hold Down action option didn't work for long-press triggers.
- Opening a keymap with a long-press parallel trigger would set it to short press.
- Crash if a modifier key trigger is not mapped to a Key Event action.
- Potential crash when showing keymaps on the homescreen.
- Attempt to fix the problem of the accessibility service being enabled but broken on some devices.
- Typo in the dialog message prompting the user to reboot.
- The dialog prompting the user to reboot would show at the wrong time.
- Switch to a new App Intro library. Hopefully it is more stable because the old library was crashing for many users.
