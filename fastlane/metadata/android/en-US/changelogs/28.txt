Significantly improved the input latency.

Added
- Actions can now have unique repeat options and any action is allowed to be repeated now.
- Screen on/off constraints (ROOT only).
- Option for keymaps with volume key triggers to be detected when the screen is off (ROOT only).
- Option to stop repeating an action when the trigger is pressed again.
- Button in the homescreen menu to resume/pause keymaps and enable the accessibility service.
- Setting to hide the alerts at the top of the homescreen.
- Action to take screenshots on rooted devices older than Pie.

Bug Fixes
- Triggers with the Recents and Home button would sometimes open Recents and go Home.
- Increase the screen width threshold to put all the cards in one tab to 1000dp.
- Don't crash when sometimes changing a slider.
- Lower the max repeat delay to 1000ms to make it easier to pick tiny values.
- Increase the min repeat delay to 5ms because 0ms caused crashes.

Changes
- Persist whether keymaps are paused.
- The "Switch Keyboard" action now works when the app has WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission rather than just rooted devices.

Removed
- Setting to show a toast message when an action fails. Removing this made improving the input latency much easier.
