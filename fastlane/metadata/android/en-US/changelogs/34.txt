Added
- Prompt the user to reboot their device if they fail to record a trigger 2 times in a row.
- Show a toast after using the Screenshot (ROOT) action.

Bug Fixes
- Dragging trigger keys by the remove button would cause a crash
- stop recording if the user leaves the Trigger fragment
- The Menu (ROOT) action was slow
- Entering an invalid integer into the keycode box when creating a Key Event action would cause a crash.
- show a toast if there is an IOException when detecting buttons when the screen is off.
- Remapping modifier keys to modifier keys doesn't work as expected.
- the Screenshot (ROOT) action didn't create the Pictures and Screenshots directories. Therefore, it didn't save the screenshot.
- Hold Down action option didn't work for long-press triggers.
- Opening a keymap with a long-press parallel trigger would set it to short press.
- JSON files are sometimes greyed out when picking a file to restore. All file types are now shown because Android doens't have a mimetype for JSON files.
- Crash if a modifier key trigger is not mapped to a Key Event action.
- Potential crash when showing keymaps on the homescreen.
