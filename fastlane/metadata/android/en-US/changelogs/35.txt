Bug Fixes

- App crashed when starting the accessibility service on Android Marshmallow 6.0 and older. OOPS XD.
- The Menu action wouldn't sometimes work on rooted devices.
- Attempt to fix the problem of the accessibility service being enabled but broken on some devices.
- Typo in the dialog message prompting the user to reboot.
- The dialog prompting the user to reboot would show at the wrong time.
- Switch to a new App Intro library. Hopefully it is more stable because the old library was crashing for many users.
